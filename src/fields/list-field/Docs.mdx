# `listField<Fields>(): RequiredListField<Fields>`

A generic field to capture list of generic items. You can think of each item as a separate form. It requires a `builder` function returning fields, which will be used inside of the form.

```ts
import { listField } from "@form-atoms/field";
```

## Initial Config

<Markdown>{Config}</Markdown>

> **NOTE:** The zod schema needs to validate only the array itself.
> There is no need for the underlying item schema, as each field of the item has a separate schema against which the field value will be validated.

## Configuration

### `builder: (value: FormValues<Fields>) => Fields` (required)

The `listField` is defined by the shape of the fields returned from its builder. If you supply an initial `value`, each of the items will be applied to the builder.

#### Building a list of objects

Commonly the list item is a mini-form, which has multiple fields. Here we have environment variables, each having a `name` and a `value` properties:

```js
const environmentVariables = listField({
  value: [
    { name: "GITHUB_TOKEN", value: "myToken" },
    { name: "NPM_TOKEN", value: "privateToken" },
  ],
  builder: ({ name, value }) => ({
    name: textField({ value: name }),
    value: textField({ value }),
  }),
});
```

#### Building a list of primitive values

Here, our items are plain strings `typeof item === "string"`:

```js
const typeScriptBenefits = listField({
  value: ["safe function calls", "it's fast"],
  builder: (item) => textField({ value: item }),
});
```

## API

### `.optional(readRequired?: ReadRequired) => OptionalListField<Fields>`

The list fields are required by default, meaning that `config.schema` is used in validation.
This means that at least one item must be in the list in order to submit the form.

You can call the `.optional()` method, to use the `config.optionalSchema` instead:

```js
const field = listField(config).optional();
```

The optional list field can be submited as an empty array.

#### Conditionaly optional field

You can pass a Jotai getter function as the argument to make the field conditionaly required:

```js
// other field or atom
const required = atom(true);

const field = listField(config).optional((get) => {
  return get(required);
});
```

> **NOTE** once the `.optional()` was called, the field type will be `OptionalListField`. The runtime required state has no effect on the static type.

#### Idempotent behavior

Calling optional on optional field returns the same field:

```js
const field = listField().optional();
const ref = field.optional();

field === ref; // true
```
