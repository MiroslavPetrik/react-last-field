# Features

## Controllable optionality

We extend the default `fieldAtom` with a `required` state. This allows us to specify optional & required `zod` validators for the most common cases.
All the data fields are of type `ZodField` which extends the default `FieldAtom`.
Finally, the `required` state is used on UI layer to display requirement indicators to users or to set `aria` properties.

## `undefined` as empty values

When users leave your optional fields untouched, you will receive `undefined` values in the form submit data.

## Pre-defined `zod` validators

Our fields know whether they are required or optional. Based on that they have pre-set validation functions.
This saves you time, provides runtime safety, and will error when you use a data field with mismatching input type.

## Naming

Unlike `form-atoms` our field constructor functions do not have the `atom` suffix, as the field is in reality an aggregation of dozen jotai atoms.
