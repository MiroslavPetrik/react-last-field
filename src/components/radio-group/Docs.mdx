# RadioGroup

A combination of generic [useSelectFieldProps](?path=/docs/hooks-useselectfieldprops--docs) and [useOptions](?path=/docs/hooks-useoptions--docs)
which renders the options as a list of `<input type="radio" />`.

```ts
import { RadioGroup } from "@form-atoms/field";
```

### Alternative

- [Select](?path=/docs/components-select--docs) component is an alternative for a single-choice answer.
- Prefer the `RadioGroup` when there are few options to select from.
